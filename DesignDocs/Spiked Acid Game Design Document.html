  <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

  <p>This document describes a game called "Through the Ages", which is designed to be a 2D platformer and 
  action game. It will use sprites for animation, a grid system using 'Tiled' for backgrounds, and phaser for physics,
  collisions, and other game programming functions.</p>
<br>

  <h3>TECHNOLOGY</h3>

  <p>Through The Ages will be developed for web browsers using the 
    Phaser game engine which is a Desktop and Mobile HTML5 game framework 
    created by <a href="https://github.com/photonstorm">Richard Davey (Photonstorm)</a>. WebGL 
    primarily handles the rendering for the Phaser framework. Audio and music 
    will be created in Audacity. Tiled will be used to create the levels. Sprites 
    and tilesets will be relatively simplistic and will created in Fire Alpaca.</p>
  <br>

  <h3>BACK STORY</h3>

  <p>Through the Ages will attempt to recreate a span of history. The player, who controls Gareth I and his descendants through the ages,
    moves through each levels by collecting objects that will help move human civilization into the modern age. Once he has all
    of the necessary technology and supplies, he moves forward through history, all while his enemies try to defeat him and halt human progress.
    Can Gareth overcome all odds and move humanity into the future?
  </p>
<br>

  <h3>OBJECTIVE</h3>

  <p>Gareth's task is to explore the world and find and collect all of the technological
    advancements of his current age. Once he has collected one he must bring it back to his family.
    Once Gareth's family has possesion of all the items the can safely survive until the next age.
    Unfortunatly for Gareth these items are scattered through out the world and he only has the space 
    in his pockets for one item at a time. 
  </p>

  <p>The world that Gareth and his family live in is a very dangerous place. The local wildlife have taken
    a liking to the items and will go to any means to keep them. This means that Gareth will have to protect
    himself using the weapon of the current age that has been given to him by his family.
  </p>

<br>

  <h3>GAMEPLAY</h3>

  <p>The game will be a 2D platformer with several levels. Gareth will be able to run side to side, 
    leap up and down, double jump, etc. Each level will have a collection of items scattered around it that are required to
    reach the next milestone in human progress (ex. Fire in pre historic times, gunpowder/telescope in medieval times etc.).
  </p>


  <p>This process will not be unopposed, however, as Gareth will be opposed at each step of the way by the enemies of humanity 
    during each time period, from dinosaurs to aliens. In each era, Gareth will find that the items are placed in a variety of different
    locales, and the locations of the items and the items themselves will be different as well. Gareth will fight these enemies and attempt to collect 
    all of these together, pushing humanity further along. Luckily, Gareth will have some help along the way:
  </p>

   <ul>
    <li>Evolving technology means evolving armor and weapons as well. Gareth can better defend himself in each consecutive level.</li>
    <li>Power ups will randomly appear and will be unique to each time period. For example, in prehistoric times, when Gareth is attacked by dinosaurs, a meteor strike can be used to defeat them all.</li>
    <li>Once his civilization has been built up substantially, Gareth can employ the aid of other citizens or technologies.</li>
   </ul>

  <p>Gareth will collect items in the wild and return them to his ever growing city, gradullay improving its technology. Eventually,
    the city is able to progress further through history, and Gareth I passes the torch to Gareth II who passes it to Gareth III, and so on.
  </p>

  <h3>CONTROLS</h3>

  <p>The game will be controlled exclusively with the keyboard, with a similar control scheme to most platformer games</p>

   <ul>
    <li><strong>A, D, Arrwy Keys</strong> - Will move Gareth left and right along the current platform/floor</li>
    <li><strong>Spacebar</strong> - Makes Gareth jump</li>
    <li><strong>Right Shift</strong> - When by an item and no item in his pocket, Gareth will pick up the item. If by his home, and with an item in his pocket, Gareth will drop the item off.</li>
    <li><strong>Right Enter</strong> - Gareth attacks in the direction he is facing.</li>
    <li><strong>Right Control</strong> - Provided he has a special attack token in his pocket, Gareth will execute his special attack.</li>
    <li><strong>Escape</strong> - Will pause the Game</li>
   </ul>
<br>

  <h3>GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE</h3>

  <p>As far as the GUI is concerned, if we consider</p>

  <ul>
   <li><strong>Splash Screen</strong> - The splash screen GUI simply 
presents a game logo and a Start button for the user to press when they 
are ready to play. Upon pressing it, a brief scripted sequence is played
 explaining a little about Gareth, his family and the back story for the game. While 
presenting the message "Press Enter to Skip" should be displayed at the 
bottom of the screen. If pressed, the game should immediately start.</li>
<br>

   <li><strong>In-Game Menu</strong> - While the game is in progress, we'll always have a game menu that allows the player to select from the following options:
    <ul>
     <li><strong>New Game</strong> - If a game is in progress, first 
we'll pop up a dialog to make sure the user really wants to quit the 
current game. If we conclude the user really wants to start a game, then
 the game state is reset and begun.</li>
     <li><strong>Pause Game</strong> - This button is deactivated when a game is not in progress. If pressed, it will produce the same effect as the ESC key.</li>
     <li><strong>Display Controls</strong> - If pressed, the game will display an info screen that includes a description of all game controls.</li>
     <li><strong>Best Times</strong> - If pressed, the game will display an info screen with the fastest times for clearing the level.</li>
     <li><strong>About</strong> - If pressed, the game will display an info screen with information about the game author.</li>
     <li><strong>Exit</strong> - If pressed, the game program will exit.</li>
    </ul></li>
<br>

   <li><strong>In-Game GUI</strong> - Once a game starts, Gareth will walk into view from the left side at
    the bottom of the level. Once he reaches his starting point the level's monsters will move around and
    try to attack Gareth if he gets too close to the items. 
    While playing the following will be displayed at all times:
    <ul>
     <li>Time Elapsed</li>
     <li>Items delivered</li>
     <li>Item currently held</li>
     <li>A health bar</li>
    </ul>
   </li>
  </ul>
<br>

  <h3>ARTWORK</h3>

  <p>We will create the following artwork for Through the Ages</p>

  <ul>
   <li><strong>Gareth and his descendants</strong> Gareth and his descendents share a striking resemblance, in both name and looks. Gareth I looks the same as Gareth XXIV,
    aside from the time appropriate armor each of them dons.
    <ul>
     <li>Walking animations</li>
     <li>Jumping animations</li>
     <li>Collect and Drop item</li>
     <li>Use power up</li>
     <li>Attacking Animations</li>
     <li>Death Animations</li>
    </ul></li>
<br>
   <li><strong>Enemies</strong> - Dinosaurs, enemy knights, evil robots etc. Gareth's challengers
    <ul>
     <li>Walking animations</li>
     <li>Attacking animations</li>
     <li>Death Animations</li>
    </ul></li>
<br>

   <li><strong>Gareth's City</strong> - Gareth's city will expand in size and will progress through history during each level.</li>
<br>

   <li><strong>Platforms</strong> - Each level will contain a variety of platforms and barriers around which Gareth must jump to find his necessary items.
  These will range from glaciers during the ice age, to mountains, etc.</li>
<br>

   <li><strong>Backgrounds</strong> - Each era will have a background tileset that reflects the era in history: ex. A gothic castle for the middle ages.</li>
  </ul>
<br>



  <h3>SOUND EFFECTS</h3>

  <p>We will make sound effects for the following:</p>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>Gareth (I-XXIV) Movement</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Gareth's attacks</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Gareth hit by an enemy</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Gareth hits an enemy</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Gareth is killed</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Advance civilization</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Item acquired</strong></li>
   </ul>
<br>

  <h3>MUSIC</h3>

  <p>Provided there will be enough time, music appropriate for each time period will be added..</p>
