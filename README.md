In Through the Ages you play as Gareth I, Gareth IV, Gareth XI, and Gareth XXV, all members of the noble house of Gareth, as he tries to keep himeself and his family safe while progressing through history. Your journey starts with Gareth I, as he struggles to collect the materials necessary to create fire. Once you have collected enough to make it through the stone ages, the timeline flashes forward to the middle ages, as Gareth IV fights to keep the forge alight in order to craft more impressive weapons and armor.

All along the way, Gareth and his ancestors are hounded by pterodactyls, killer pigeons, and robots. Do you have what it takes to survive Through The Ages?

Your goal in the game is to collect items and carry them back to your origin point. You may only carry one item at a time. Careful of the flying creatures! You only have 3 lives, and each life lasts for 5 enemy hits. You can fight back with your spear, but be careful, you are not the only one evolving - the enemies will get smarter (and more difficult) with each passing stage.
