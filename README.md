### Benchmark 2 explanation

For this benchmark we built a rough structure for Level 1 of our game, as well as structure for the other 3 levels, though these are not yet selectable through the menus (The menus contain links to them, but level information does not yet load). Artwork used is not final, though the player sprite is most likely final. Each level will use a different player sprite and a different tileset. Menus will likely be further updated as well.
